Hi, this is the repository for my a11y basics talk. It uses eleventy as a static site generator plus a gulp toolchain.

- `npm install` - install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - run a dev server with browsersync
- `npm run build` - run a full page build
- `npx eleventy` - build just the html
- `npx gulp` - build the scss, js and compress images
