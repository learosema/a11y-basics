# Low vision

- Various forms of vision impairments
- Vision may be blurry or partly limited
- People may not be able to see bright colors or too strong contrast
- People may experience pain when looking at bright lights
- An all-white background is problematic
- There is magnifier software with screen reader functionality for low vision, eg. ZoomText
- Users may modify the colors either in their operating system or in the web browser
- There are [custom stylesheets](http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/css/) which can be used as overrides
