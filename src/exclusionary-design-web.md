# Exclusionary design on the web

- Cookie banners you can't close without using a mouse/finger or other pointing device
- Providing an accessible version of the site but which is lesser or not maintained
- “Call us for accessibility, we'll assist you.”
- Relying only on mouse/pointer events
- Low color contrast
- Missing Image descriptions
