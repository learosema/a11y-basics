# Semantic HTML

- Semantic HMTL elements convey a meaning
- You can give your HTML a certain structure which improves screenreader user's orientation (eg. providing `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`)
- There are also ARIA role representations for them. Only use them as a last resort.
- Some HTML elements (especially interactive ones like `<button>`) bring built-in functionality, while with ARIA roles you need to rebuild this functionality on your own.
