# Color Blindness

- Most common is red-green color-blindness
- Some people have blue-yellow color-blindness
- Very rare: insensitivity to all colors (people see colors in grayscale)
- Red and black color-blindness

## Design considerations

- critical: Do not use color alone to communicate information
