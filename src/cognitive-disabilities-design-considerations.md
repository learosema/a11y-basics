# Cognitive Disabilities

## Design Considerations

- simplify the interface and content as much as possible
- keep videos and audio as short as possible
- limit the number of choices on the screen
- provide help features
- test with actual users
- Retain information accross screens, and within a path
- Reduce or eliminate distractions (be careful with ads, carousels, intrusive audio/video)
