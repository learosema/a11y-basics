# Accessibility is independence

The web platform can make people with disabilities more independent.

People with disabilities can do tasks from their computer on their own while otherwise in the physical world they would face barriers or are unable at all to accomplish these tasks.

<strong>BUT:</strong> only if it's built with accessibility in mind
