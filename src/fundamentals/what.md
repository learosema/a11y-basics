# Accessibility is Freedom

- The web platform has the potential to make people with disabilities more independent
- People with disabilities can perform tasks from their computer on their own, such as
  - shopping
  - banking
  - working
  - watching entertainment
  - playing games

<strong>BUT:</strong> only if the web sites and products are built with accessibility in mind

## Accessibility does not happen by accident

- It has to be purposefully planned, built, and tested for accessibility. 
- Inaccessible web sites deprive users with disabilities of experiences and opportunities that other people take for granted
- Also, they put companies at legal risk for discrimination lawsuits.
