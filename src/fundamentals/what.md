# Accessibility is Freedom

- The web platform has the potential to make people with disabilities more independent
- People with disabilities can perform tasks from their computer on their own
  - shopping
  - banking
  - working
  - watching entertainment
  - playing games

<strong>BUT:</strong> only if the web sites and products are built with accessibility in mind
