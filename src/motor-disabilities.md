# Motor disabilities

- Motor disabilities can refer to a range of physical experiences.
- can be temporary or chronical
- some people with motor disabilities use assistive software along with assistive hardware, such as alternative input devices

## Design considerations

- All functionality must be available only using the keyboard
  links, buttons and controls must have a visible :focus state and should have a visible :hover state
- With session time-outs, warn users before the time expires and give them the option to extend the session. Ensure the warning itself allows for slow responses. A recommended minimum response time is 2 minutes
- Provide large click targets (links, buttons, controls)
