# Blindness

## Design considerations

- Content must be presented in text or via a text equivalent
- Information must not be conveyed by visual attributes alone
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Use markup with good structure and semantics
- Users must receive immediate feedback after all actions

### On mobile devices

- All features require a click action
- Custom swipe actions on web pages will not work with the screen reader
