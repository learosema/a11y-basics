# WAI-ARIA

- Almost entirely for screenreader users
- Used to fill the gaps between the features of HTML and accessibility needs of web applications
- Conveys what an element does (`role` attribute)
- Conveys the current state of an element (eg. if a toggle button is pressed)
- There are HTML elements which have roles built in (”Semantic HTML“)
- Prefer semantic HTML over aria attributes.
