# WAI-ARIA

- WAI stands for Web Accessibility Initiative, ARIA for Accessible Rich Internet Applications ([Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/))
- Almost entirely for screenreader users
- Used to fill the gaps between the features of HTML and accessibility needs of web applications
- Gives information about what role a specific HTML element has
- There are HTML elements which have roles built in (”Semantic HTML“)
- Prefer semantic HTML over aria attributes. See also: [No ARIA is better than bad aria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/#no_aria_better_bad_aria)
