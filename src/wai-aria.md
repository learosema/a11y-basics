# WAI-ARIA

- Almost entirely for screenreader users
- Used to fill the gaps between the features of HTML and accessibility needs of web applications

## ARIA can help screen reader users know...

- If a link opens a popup window
- If an object is expandable
- If an object is currently expanded or collapsed
- If something has changed or been updated on the page
- What type of object or widget it is (eg. a tab panel, a tab, a slider, an alert dialog, ...)
