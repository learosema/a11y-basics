# WAI-ARIA

- WAI stands for Web Accessibility Initiative, ARIA for Accessible Rich Internet Applications ([Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/))
- Almost entirely for screenreader users
- Used to fill the gaps between the features of HTML and accessibility needs of web applications
- Prefer semantic HTML over aria attributes. See also: [No ARIA is better than bad aria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/#no_aria_better_bad_aria)
- Can help screen reader users know...
  - If a link opens a popup window
  - If an object is expandable
  - If an object is currently expanded or collapsed
  - If something has changed or been updated on the page
  - What type of object or widget it is (eg. a tab panel, a tab, a slider, an alert dialog, ...)
