# Seizures

## Design Considerations for Seizure Disorders

- Don't include videos, animations or transitions with flashing light sequences of 3 times or more per second
- additional potential triggers are emotional content, too much screen time
- add trigger warnings if you include triggering content
- remember your users to take breaks (eg. if you run a learning platform)
