# Low vision

## Design considerations

- Do not disable pinch to zoom (avoid `<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no">`)
- all text must pass contrast guidelines (verify via aXe)
- Links, buttons and controls must have a visible :focus state and should have a visible :hover state
- User interface should provide a clear distinction between content and controls
