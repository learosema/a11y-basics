# Stigmatizing Design

Side Entrance of my workplace, which is potentially more accessible (but still isn't, it still has stairs but less, and there's an elevator).
It leads past the garbage room which isn't separated by a door. It's quite smelly in there. Providing a lesser
attractive side entrance for people with disabilities is called stigmatizing design.
